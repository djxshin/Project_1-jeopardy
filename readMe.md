# Quentin Tarantino Film Theme Jeopardy

## Overview

First the users will be on the Home Page to have an idea that this will be a themed Jeopardy.  What kind of theme?  Jeopardy questions that are based on the films directed by Quentin Tarantino.  Once they have an idea that it's a themed Jeopardy, they will be able to select between a SINGLE player mode, or 2 PLAYER mode.

**Single Player 

With single player mode they'll play a Jeopardy game with 5 different categories that are organized by the films directed by Quentin Tarantino, overall there will be 5 categories.

* For each category (films) it'll have four different point system, points will differ by each of the rows which will start from 100 pts and the points will go up on consecutive order as follow:  

* 100pts
* 200ts
* 300pts
* 400pts

Each question selected will have four multiple choice answers that the user will choose from.
Based on the answer chosen, it'll either be the right answer which will accumulate the corresponding points to the counter which the user will be able to see.

if you answer right it'll add the corresponding value of points, if you guess wrong it'll subtract the corresponding value of points.

If you go below negative points, it'll show an sweetalert as an engouragment.

Game will end once you answer all 20 questions and it'll give you a sweet alert once all the questions are answered.

**Two Player 

Everything in two player mode is basically the same except for:

two seprate innerHTML to keep track of points for each player
Tally of who's turn it is on the bottom in case the plyaers lose track of who's turn it is.
